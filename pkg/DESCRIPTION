Description: Recursive segmentation (rseg) makes use of recursive partitioning methods to perform exploratory subgroup analysis in an automated manner that resembles the patient rule induction method (PRIM). Therefore, tree models are fit to the data to identify subsets with outstanding outcome values. These are iteratively removed from the data which yields a sequence of subsets, called 'segments'.
